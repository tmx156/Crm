Dear Avensis Models UK,


I hope this message finds you well.


Unfortunately, my personal advisor will not be available on Saturday, so I
will not be able to attend the consultation scheduled for Saturday,
27/09/2025 at 15:45.


I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. I would like to
kindly request if it would be possible to reschedule my appointment to
Thursday, 02/10/2025, at any time during the day that works best for your
team.


On Thursday, I will attend the consultation together with my personal
advisor, and I will make sure to be fully prepared with everything required.


I kindly ask you to please confirm the new appointment via email once it
has been rescheduled.


Thank you very much for your understanding and support. I greatly
appreciate your flexibility and look forward to your confirmation.


Kind regards,

MUSAB ABDULHAMED
